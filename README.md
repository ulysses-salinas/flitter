# Phase 2 Project: Flitter - A Twitter Clone

## Project Explanation
Our task was to build a copy of an existing web application using the backend technologies we have learned in Phase 2 of the DigitalCrafts Houston Flex Course.
> The decision to do a Twitter clone mainly went like this:  
> Team member 1: So guys, what are we thinking for the project?  
> Team member 2: Uuuhhhhmmmm.....  
> Team member 3: Not sure.....  
> Team member 1: Yeeaaahhh......  
> Undetermined Team member: Twitter clone?  
> The other members: Sounds good!
